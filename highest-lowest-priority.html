            <strong>2.1.1 Keyboard</strong> - All functionality is operable
            through a keyboard interface.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Keyboard accessibility is
                fundamental for users with motor impairments, as many cannot use
                a mouse. Non-compliance would completely block access for these
                users, making it critical for both usability and legal

            <strong>1.1.1 Non-text Content</strong> - Text alternatives for
            non-text content.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Providing text alternatives for
                non-text content (like images or charts) is essential for users
                who rely on screen readers. Without this, visually impaired
                users would miss key information making this a fundamental

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</strong> â€“ Ensure a contrast ratio
            of 4.5:1 for text.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Insufficient contrast makes text
                difficult to read for users with low vision. This impacts a wide
                range of users and is frequently cited in legal cases for
                non-compliance, making it a high-priority requirement under WCAG
                Level AA.
              </li>

            <strong>4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</strong> - Ensure that programmatic
            states, properties, and values are defined for UI components.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Assistive technologies depend on
                programmatically defined states and properties to interact with
                user interface components. If these are not defined, users who
                rely on assistive technologies will be unable to use the website
                effectively. This is crucial for screen reader functionality and
                WCAG Level A compliance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</strong> - Users can navigate out of
            any component using a keyboard.
            <ul>
              <li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</strong> - The structure of
            content should be programmatically determined.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Defining the structure of content
                programmatically ensures that assistive technologies can
                correctly interpret the relationships between elements,

                guideline is critical for users of screen readers and is
                required under WCAG Level A.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4.3 Focus Order</strong> - Logical focus order for
            interactive elements.
            <ul>
              <li>

                users navigating via keyboard can move through interactive
                elements in an intuitive way. Improper focus order can confuse
                users, particularly those with motor or visual impairments,
                making this a necessary requirement for usability and WCAG Level
                A compliance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4.7 Focus Visible</strong> - Keyboard focus is clearly
            visible.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> A visible focus indicator is crucial
                for users who navigate via keyboard, ensuring they can track
                which element is currently selected. Lack of focus visibility
                can make navigation impossible, leading to non-compliance with
                WCAG Level AA.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.4.4 Resize Text</strong> - Text can be resized up to 200%
            without loss of content.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Users with low vision often need to
                resize text to read it comfortably. Ensuring that text can be
                resized without breaking content or layout ensures accessibility
                for a wide range of users, making it a key requirement under
                WCAG Level AA.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</strong> - Contrast of 3:1 for
            non-text UI components.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Adequate contrast for non-text
                elements, such as buttons or form fields, ensures that all
                users, particularly those with low vision, can perceive and
                interact with the UI. Non-compliance would reduce usability,
                making this a WCAG Level AA requirement.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)</strong> - The purpose of
            each link is clear.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Ensuring that the purpose of each
                link is clear from its context helps screen readers and users
                with cognitive disabilities understand where the link leads.
                This is vital for navigation and usability under WCAG Level AA.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.4.1 Use of Color</strong> - Color is not the only means of
            conveying information.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Relying on color alone to convey
                information excludes users who are color blind or have low
                vision. This is essential for accessibility and compliance with
                WCAG Level A.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4.6 Headings and Labels</strong> - Clear and descriptive
            headings and labels.
            <ul>
              <li>

                with WCAG Level AA.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</strong> - Ensures that content is
            presented in a logical and intuitive order.
            <ul>
              <li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</strong> - Ability to skip repetitive
            content.
            <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1.4.5 Images of Text</strong> - Use actual text rather than
            images of text.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Using text instead of images of text
                ensures that content is scalable and accessible to users with
                low vision or those relying on screen readers. Non-compliance
                can make content difficult to interact with, reducing usability
                across devices and screen sizes.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.2.2 On Input</strong> - No change of context when UI
            components gain focus.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Input changes should not
                automatically trigger context changes unless explicitly
                communicated to the user. This guideline helps maintain user
                control and prevents disorientation, especially for users with
                cognitive disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
