          Accessibility in HTML with Examples & Best Practices
        </h1>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Web accessibility is guided by four key principles:
          <strong> perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</strong>
          These principles ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities
          or disabilities, can access and interact with online content
          effectively. The purpose of the document "Accessibility in HTML with
          Examples and Best Practices" is to guide developers and content
          creators in designing accessible HTML components. It provides
          practical examples and best practices to ensure digital content is
          usable by everyone.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-title mt-4">Web Complaince</h2>
        <p>
          Web accessibility compliance involves adhering to legal standards and
          guidelines that ensure digital content is accessible to all users,
          including those with disabilities. Laws like the Section 508 mandate
          specific accessibility criteria, while the Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (WCAG) outline best practices for creating accessible
          content. Compliance helps organizations avoid legal issues and fosters
          inclusivity, enhancing the user experience for a diverse audience.

          <strong style="color: #643a98">Note*</strong>: The following
          documentation does not cover all of the WCAG AAA requirements. For all
          compliance, you can visit the provided links given in front of all
          four major principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and
          Robust.
